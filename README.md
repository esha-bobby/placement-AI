A simple, smart placement portal for colleges.

## What’s inside
- **Student side**: Upload your resume, update your profile, and see which companies are coming to campus.  
- **AI matching**: Get a percentage match with every company based on your skills and details.  
- **Admin side**: Companies (and placement officers) can log in, post openings, and schedule interviews.

## Why it’s cool
No more endless spreadsheets. Students and recruiters meet in one place, and the AI does the boring matching work.
